# ðŸ“’ Ledger API

This project is a **basic ledger system** that keeps track of money moving between accounts.  
It follows the idea of **double-entry accounting**, which means that every transaction has both a debit and a credit, and the total must always balance to zero.

Think of it as a very simple bookkeeping tool that you can interact with through an API.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
4. The API will be available at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## ðŸ“Œ Main Concepts

- **Account** â†’ Represents a place where money is stored (e.g., "Cash", "Bank", "Expenses").  
  Each account has:
  - A **direction**: `debit` or `credit`
  - A **balance** (starts at 0 unless set when created)

- **Transaction** â†’ A movement of money that affects two or more accounts.  
  Example: If you move $100 from your "Bank" account to "Cash", the bank is reduced, and cash is increased.

- **Entry** â†’ A single line inside a transaction. It says:
  - Which account is affected
  - Whether itâ€™s a **debit** or **credit**
  - How much money is moving

## ðŸ“– Example Flow

1. Create two accounts:
   - "Bank" (credit)
   - "Cash" (debit)

2. Move $100 from "Bank" to "Cash":
   - The bank account balance goes **down by 100**
   - The cash account balance goes **up by 100**

3. Check all accounts:
   ```bash
   GET /accounts
   ```

4. Check all transactions:
   ```bash
   GET /transactions
   ```

---

## âœ… Notes

- Every transaction must balance: total debits = total credits.  
- You cannot directly change account balances; only transactions can do that.  
- The storage is **in memory** â†’ if you restart the server, data will reset.
